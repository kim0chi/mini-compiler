# ðŸ›  Design Overview

## ðŸ“¦ Architecture

The project follows a classic compiler pipeline:

```text
Source Code
    â†“ Lexer â†’ Token Stream
    â†“ Parser â†’ AST
    â†“ Semantic Analyzer
    â†“ TAC Generator â†’ Raw 3-address code
    â†“ Optimizer â†’ Optimized TAC
    â†“ Codegen â†’ NASM Assembly
    â†“ Execution (Interpreter)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Design Choices

- **LL(1) parser**: Implemented via recursive descent, with proper precedence climbing for expressions
- **AST-based pipeline**: Every stage operates on high-level AST nodes for clarity and modularity
- **Swing GUI**: Allows user input, live compilation, and separate output panes for each stage
- **Type inference**: Dynamically determines variable type during `read` or assignment
- **Error reporting**: All major errors (syntax, semantic, runtime) tracked with line/column positions

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

Each stage is verified through:
- Manual test cases via GUI
- Console output logs for TAC and ASM
- Semantic failure checks (wrong types, undeclared vars, division by zero)

## ðŸ“š Dependencies

- Java 17+
- No external libraries (pure Java)
